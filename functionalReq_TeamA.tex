\subsection{Functional Requirements Review}
Treads.getThreadStats
The getThreadStats function has achieved what it needs to do but it has minimal error checking.The parameters that are required are all available.The set parameter contains a list of posts.The action parameter is tested for Num, MemCount, MaxDepth, AvgDepth.The action that is specified will carry out the appropriate action to be done with the threads such as calculate the number of threads.There is no error checking so if the action specified is not one of the ones in the functual requirements then the return value will be null which could cause a problem when the module is integrated with the other modules.There is no exeption thrown so the function will exit without any knowlage of an error.
GetThreadAppraisal
The GetThreadAppraisal function works and produces the required output and will calculate the apraisals.All the parameters and post conditions are present.The data is stored correctly into a dataset,JSON string, which contains all the entries for that thread and a action value.The action value which is specified as one of the parameters to be either Sum,Avg,Max,Min or Num.The entries contain all of the threads and the information about the thread including an ordinal vale for the thread which is used in the calculation that is specified by the action.There is no error checking so if the action value is not one that is specified then the action value will not be set and this could cause problems in integration.
ExportThreadAppraisal
The ExportThreadAppraisal function works and runs without error.The function has only one parameter which is a threadID parameter which is used to get the thread and then it creates a CSV file using a helper function.The CSV file is created with all the relavent information about the threads appraisals and then is downloaded for the user.IF the ThreadID is not in the system the functions exits but does not notify the user of this error.
